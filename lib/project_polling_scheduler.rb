#
# Asynchronous IO (via the Reactor model) can be a little confusing, so a bit
# of an explanation is in order:
#
# This poller basically looks for all projects that need updating, then asks
# the project to build a workload, which is a list of jobs that need to be
# completed. A job is essentially a URL that needs to be fetched.
#
# When the complete list of jobs has been completed, the handler is notified and
# the project is updated. The workload model is used as jobs can be completed
# in any order.
